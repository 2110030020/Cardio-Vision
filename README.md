 ** Cardio-Vision **
ImpacTech2k23 is a hackathon conducted at KL University Hyderabad where our team have developed an AI-Driven Cardiovascular Risk Assessment using Python, Flask, Machine Learning, HTML &amp; CSS

 # * Objectives: *

The objective is to create a website that allows users to assess their risk of cardiovascular and heart diseases by considering their lifestyle and family history. Users input lifestyle factors such as age, height, weight, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and details about alcohol or smoking habits, along with their family history. We use AI and machine learning to produce predictions based on the data provided by the user. After generating predictions, we offer recommendations for medications and heart health improvements based on the individual's specific needs and circumstances.
